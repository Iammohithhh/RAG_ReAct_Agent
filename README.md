**Project Description:**
This project helps mentees transition from Deep Learning to deploying LLMs using Hugging Face. By the end, they will:
1. Understand core DL concepts (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers).
2. Learn Hugging Faceâ€™s ecosystem (Models, Datasets, Pipelines).
3. Implement a real-world LLM application (e.g., chatbot, text summarizer, sentiment analysis tool).
Key Learning Areas:
âœ… Deep Learning Refresher (PyTorch/TensorFlow)
âœ… Transformer Architecture (Attention, BERT, GPT)
âœ… Hugging Face Libraries (transformers, datasets, accelerate)
